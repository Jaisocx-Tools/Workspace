# CSS Tools

## The aim of the setup

The CSS Tools project is aimed to install via npm and yarn, or downloading a .zip package from the github,
and use at once the css solutions for some ui development tasks. Every Css tool can be installed separately by npm registry.



### CSS Sites Tools have advantages:

1. `No transpilation` needed. (For the `webpack` builds the `transpilation is needed` with the `ProjectBuilder` in this project. For install via `hardcopy` or use with a `cdn link`, a themes webpack `bundle.js`, too).

2. `No line JavaScript` code needed.

3. `Advanced theming` support.

4. Advanced support for bugfixing and fine-tuning `responsive layout`.

5. Interactivity with `CSS events`, like :hover and others.

6. The tools will be the simplier copies of the ObjectData rendering, and JS or JSON styling sites tools in this Workspace, or the `prototypes and ideas for the JS tools`, and when later writing a js tool, `to extend from a css sites tool`.

7. `CSS Seletors weight to prove`: A css or js or json rendering sites tool is `well seeing as in examples on npm in readme.md`, within any html tree with unforeseen styles and css classnames. I'll build later a single page app in a js framework to prove sites tools, whether the sites tools are seeing well, `after installed via npm or yarn` and html snippets are set hardcoded `in some another existing site`.
