# CSS Tools

## The aim of the setup

The CSS Tools project is aimed to install via npm and yarn, or downloading a .zip package from the github,
and use at once the css solutions for some ui development tasks. Every Css tool can be installed separately by npm registry.



### CSS Sites Tools have advantages:

1. No transpilation needed
2. No line JavaScript code needed.
3. Advanced theming support.
4. Advanced support for bugfixing and fine-tuning responsive layout.
5. Interactivity with CSS events, like :hover and others.
6. The tools will be the simplier copies of the Js tools in this Workspace, or the prototypes and ideas for the JS tools, and when later writing a js tool, to extend from a css sites tool.
