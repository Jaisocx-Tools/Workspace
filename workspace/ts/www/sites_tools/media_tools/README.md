# media_tools

## The Aim Of The Setup

Similar to cdn, the fonts with images, 
stored once centrally.

These files are used in the example .html pages of sites tools preview.

Every filesset small and for one theme the one smaller files pack in one new npm package.



### Fonts and Images

The hardcopies of fonts and images, 
later smaller videos and audios either, 
used in example .html pages for sites tools preview.



### The CSS To Import These Fonts Or Images

The nice fine-tuning .css solutions to set fonts for text blocks.



### Workaround with @jaisocx/css-importer

Also the workaround example for the @jaisocx/css-importer, 
where in this moment, as is, 
the @jaisocx/css-importer doesn't conform to the normal @aliasing rules of The Webpack.

For the @jaisocx/css-importer the future upgrade is needed, 
since this workaround here solves building of ..._resolved.css in One sites tool,
and NOT for a site packing together several sites tools having other @aliases in styles.
