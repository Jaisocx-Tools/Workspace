### WARNING renamed folders

*Docker rebuild all services required.*


The workaround to name infrastructure folders stating with dot in this project did hide the folders,
and made not easy to copy the project folders and files.


That is why I shall not name the folders starting with dot. This way of folders naming is used by the well known system software for infrastructure files.





###  WARNING about "Database Lost Unattended" when runs under Docker and then Docker conf was updated.

*This Project is with a dockerized MYSQL DATABASE Instance. Before every git pull to update this project, even without checking whether Docker settings were changed, first do **MySQL db dump** and db dump **backup**. The dockerized db services sometimes can recreate a fresh and clean db instance, when some Docker config file was changed, and after "git pull && docker compose restart", too.*

*I leave the above warning here for good for js developers, first learned docker and databases.*

This ver of the Project does not rely on examples obtaining data from "database" docker service here. **No worries for now**. I knew once this docker option, and still work with databases.

We for sure will have here nice examples published, rendering data from database with our Sites Tools.
