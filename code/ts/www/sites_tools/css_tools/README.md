# CSS Tools

## The aim of the setup

The CSS Tools project is aimed to install via npm and yarn, or downloading a .zip package from the github,
and use at once the css solutions for some ui development tasks. Every Css tool can be installed separately by npm registry.


### Main features:

1. No transpilation needed
2. No line JavaScript code needed.
3. Advanced themin support.
4. Interactivity, using CSS events, like :hover and others.
5. The tools will be the simplier copies of the Js tools in this Workspace, or the prototypes and ideas for the JS tools to extend these.
